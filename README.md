# seuphorica

Like single-player Scrabble, but with deckbuilding.

In Seuphorica, you place words on a board, in a crossword fashion. You start with only standard tiles with letters, but you can buy new tiles with special powers!

V1: first version

V2: fixed the missing scrollbars

V3: tricky tiles, reversing tiles, nerfed retainers, fixed missing graphics for horizontal, mirror tiles have a possible multiplier bonus, more interesting interaction between retainers/teachers/trashers

V4: portal tiles, wild tiles, soothing tiles

V5: randart tiles, multi-trashers, game logging

V6: fixed both ends of portal being added to discard

V7: better portal graphics, fixed a crash when removing a portal by clicking it, fixed missing details in the game log, show tax when skipping move

V8: improved balance: nerfed draw/retain (drawing the whole bag is boring because you would just reuse the same word), nerfed wild (reset value to 0), buffed initial/final, increased taxes and shop prices

V9: changed soothing color; the radius of seen board is now bigger (but fixed); randarts no longer get 'has no special powers'

Plans: better dictionary
