# seuphorica

Like single-player Scrabble, but with deckbuilding.

In Seuphorica, you place words on a board, in a crossword fashion. You start with only standard tiles with letters, but you can buy new tiles with special powers!

V1: first version

V2: fixed the missing scrollbars

V3: tricky tiles, reversing tiles, nerfed retainers, fixed missing graphics for horizontal, mirror tiles have a possible multiplier bonus, more interesting interaction between retainers/teachers/trashers

V4: portal tiles, wild tiles, soothing tiles

V5: randart tiles, multi-trashers, game logging

V6: fixed both ends of portal being added to discard

V7: better portal graphics, fixed a crash when removing a portal by clicking it, fixed missing details in the game log, show tax when skipping move

V8: improved balance: nerfed draw/retain (drawing the whole bag is boring because you would just reuse the same word), nerfed wild (reset value to 0), buffed initial/final, increased taxes and shop prices

V9: changed soothing color; the radius of seen board is now bigger (but fixed); randarts no longer get 'has no special powers'

V10: fixed a bug with crossing on 0-value letters not detected

V11: fixed not being able to spend all your coins (> vs ≥)

V12: multi-lingual support, seed support

V13: restricted mode, daily game, controversial tile type, rich tiles make tiles appear in the shop faster

V14: fixed bugs with multipliers (soothing, naughty, reversing+initial/final, tricky+final, tricky+initial+reversing not taken into account)

V15: fixed teacher+retain combo

V16: Wizard, Redrawing, and Delayed tiles

V17: more special spots on the map, repeatedly reused words now reduce multipliers, rebalancing, more setup options

V18: fixed (and nerfed the bonus to 50%) Delayed with multiple words; fixed some bugs with portals and power/stay spots

V19: Portuguese version, new powers (Symmetric, Gigantic, Caesar), list of all powers shown in custom game, clicking on a tile on board now displays info about it,
fixed a bug with Polish and German foreign tiles description being displayed incorrectly, made daily less swingy by starting with 2 id'ed id spells

Plans: better dictionary, translate the game itself to more languages, multi-letters, drag and drop
