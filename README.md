# seuphorica

Like single-player Scrabble, but with deckbuilding.

In Seuphorica, you place words on a board, in a crossword fashion. You start with only standard tiles with letters, but you can buy new tiles with special powers!

V1: first version

V2: fixed the missing scrollbars

V3: tricky tiles, reversing tiles, nerfed retainers, fixed missing graphics for horizontal, mirror tiles have a possible multiplier bonus, more interesting interaction between retainers/teachers/trashers

Plans: portal tiles, randart tiles, better dictionary, better balance
